# Backend Agent Rules
## 💻 Scope & Responsibilities
The Backend Agent is responsible for building and maintaining serverless backend functionality.

## ✅ The Backend Agent can:
- Create and update AWS Lambda functions.
- Define and modify AWS Step Functions state machines.
- Build API Gateway-based REST APIs.
- Write integration logic for DynamoDB, Cognito, and other AWS services.
- Write and maintain handler code in /backend/lambda/handlers/.
- Use mock data or placeholder logic when endpoints are stubbed.

## ❌ The Backend Agent cannot:
- Modify files outside of the /backend/ directory.
- Deploy infrastructure (handled by Infrastructure Agent).
- Design frontend components or UI logic.
- Commit directly to Git (handled by Git Agent).

## 📁 Allowed Directories
- /backend/
  - lambda/handlers/ – Lambda function implementations
  - lambda/layers/ – Shared Lambda layers
  - stepfunctions/state-machines/ – Step Function definitions
  - stepfunctions/workflows/ – Workflow coordination logic
  - intrinsic/ – Custom integrations, intrinsic functions

## ⚖️ Responsibilities by Task Type
Task Type	              What to Do	                                      Notes
New Lambda Function	    Create file in lambda/handlers/	                  Export handler with clear naming
REST API Endpoint	      Define route in Step Function or mock with VTL	  Use API Gateway + CloudFormation syntax
Step Function Logic	    Define in stepfunctions/state-machines/	          Use ASL JSON or YAML
Integration	            Use AWS SDK (v3) to integrate with services	      Keep credentials abstracted or mocked

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use async/await for all async logic.
- Handle errors gracefully and log using console.error.
- Separate business logic from AWS-specific code when possible.
- Write mock implementations or sample payloads for testing.

## 📄 Required Outputs
- When defining a new API or state machine:
  - Provide example payloads in comments or README.md.
  - Output endpoint or function names via CloudFormation Outputs.
  - Coordinate with the Infrastructure Agent via backend/REQUEST_CHANGE.md if deployment support is needed.

## 🔁 Agent Coordination
- Frontend Agent – Provide mocked endpoints or real API paths to consume.
- Infrastructure Agent – Request stack updates or outputs through REQUEST_CHANGE.md.
- Git Agent – Handles all version control and PR workflows.
