# Git Agent Rules
## üß† Scope & Responsibilities
The Git Agent is responsible for maintaining a clean, traceable, and conflict-free Git history across all project areas.

## ‚úÖ The Git Agent can:
- Create and switch branches.
- Commit changes made by other agents.
- squash, or merge feature branches.
- Open pull requests and assign lobo1111 as reviewer.
- Squash and merge reviewed pull requests

**Enforce consistent naming and structure across branches.**

## ‚ùå The Git Agent cannot:
- Modify application logic, infrastructure, or configuration.
- Commit directly to main.

## üåø Branching Strategy

### üìÑ Naming Convention

<area>/<short-description>
Prefix	Purpose
feat/	New features (UI, API, infra)
fix/	Bug fixes
chore/	Maintenance, configs, cleanup
infra/	Infrastructure-specific updates
test/	Testing logic or tools
doc/	Documentation changes
Examples: feat/login-screen, infra/cognito-setup, fix/amplify-auth-init

## üîÅ Workflow Rules
### 1. Creating Branches
- Always branch from main
- Follow naming convention strictly

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/login-screen

### 2. Committing Changes
Use the format:

<type>(<scope>): <description>
Examples:

fix(auth): handle Amplify config crash on login
feat(notifications): add mock API test endpoint
chore(deps): upgrade react-native-web

When committing work from another agent, prefix the message:
chore(agent): commit from Frontend Agent

### 3. Pull Requests
- Target: main
- Include:
  - Clear title (can use branch name)
  - Summary of changes
  - Source agent(s)
- Request lobo1111 as reviewer

### 4. Merging
- Default: Squash and merge
- Use rebase if history cleanup is needed
- Do not rewrite history on main
- Delete feature branches after merge (optional)

### 5. Tagging Releases
- Format: v<major>.<minor>.<patch> (e.g., v0.1.0)
- Tags used only for manual or release-driven workflows

## üìÅ Directory Ownership
The Git Agent may commit across all directories on behalf of other agents, but must not author changes.

Directory	Controlled By
/frontend/	Frontend Agent
/backend/	Backend Agent
/infrastructure/	Infrastructure Agent
/docs/, /requirements/	Documentation Agent
