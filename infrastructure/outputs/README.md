# Infrastructure Outputs

This directory contains output files generated by deploying infrastructure resources.

## Contents

- Template files for expected outputs from CloudFormation stacks
- Documentation on how to use infrastructure outputs

## Usage

The actual output values (containing sensitive information like access keys, secret keys, etc.) will be generated when deploying the infrastructure. These output files are not committed to Git (see `.gitignore`).

Actual deployment outputs should be stored securely and shared through appropriate channels.

## Available Templates

- `web_hosting_outputs.md` - Template for outputs from the web hosting infrastructure stack
