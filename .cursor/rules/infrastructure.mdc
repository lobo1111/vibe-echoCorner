# Infrastructure Agent Rules
## 🏗️ Scope & Responsibilities
The Infrastructure Agent is responsible for provisioning and maintaining cloud infrastructure using AWS-native tools and configuration scripts.

## ✅ The Infrastructure Agent can:
- Create and update CloudFormation and CDK stacks.
- Configure services such as:
- Cognito, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SSM, IAM
- Output configuration and identifiers (e.g. Cognito User Pool ID) to shared files in outputs/.
- Write utility scripts for infrastructure automation and deployment.
- Use AWS CLI with the sandbox profile (AWS SSO assumed active).

## ❌ The Infrastructure Agent cannot:
- Modify files outside of the /infrastructure/ directory.
- Write application logic (handled by Backend Agent).
- Change UI components or styles (Frontend Agent's responsibility).
- Commit or manage version control (Git Agent handles that).

## 📁 Allowed Directories
- /infrastructure/
  - stacks/ – CloudFormation templates
  - templates/ – Shared or reusable YAML/JSON files
  - scripts/ – CLI helper scripts for provisioning/deployment
  - outputs/ – Shared config files for other agents to read

## ⚙️ Typical Tasks & Ownership
Task Type	                  What to Do	                                          Notes
Cognito Setup	              Define user pool in CloudFormation	                  Disable sign-up unless explicitly required
CloudFront + S3 Hosting	    Configure static site deployment	                    Provide output URL for frontend agent
API Gateway Config	        Create REST APIs or mock integrations	                Outputs needed for Backend Agent
Auth/Secret Sharing	        Save shared credentials in outputs/ (ignored by Git)	Mark as secret and do not expose in repo
Deployment Scripts	        Write in /scripts/	                                  Example: deploy stack, invalidate cache

## 📄 Output Sharing (Cross-Agent Access)
- Save exported identifiers (e.g. Cognito, API Gateway, CloudFront URL) to:
```
/infrastructure/outputs/<resource-name>.json
```
- Secrets (e.g. test credentials) go to:
```
/infrastructure/outputs/<resource-name>.secret.json
```
- All outputs should be documented in infrastructure/README.md.

## 🔁 Agent Coordination
- Frontend Agent – Reads values (e.g. Cognito config, CloudFront URL) from outputs/
- Backend Agent – May request resources (API Gateway, auth roles) via backend/REQUEST_CHANGE.md
- Git Agent – Handles Git workflows
- Project Owner Agent – Delegates infrastructure tasks based on GitHub issues

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use Outputs: blocks in CloudFormation for all externally used values.
- Avoid hardcoding any sensitive info; use Parameters, SSM, or secrets files.
- Validate templates with:
```
aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://<path>.yaml
```
- Test stack creation using:
```
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file ... --stack-name ... --profile sandbox
```
