# General Agent Rules

## Always:

- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- Pull latest changes before beginning a session
- Clearly name your Cursor IDE sessions by role (e.g., Frontend Agent | ProjectName)

## Never:

- Modify code/files outside your assigned directories
- Delete files without explicit permission
- Handle sensitive data directly (use secure storage)

# Conflict Resolution & Requests

- Clearly specify change requests via REQUEST_CHANGE.md files within your assigned directory.
- Immediately pause and request clarification upon encountering uncertainties or potential conflicts.
